A container image for {GDB}.
This project uses GDB as packaged for {Fedora} which supports targeting various architectures.

== Synopsis

Image:: https://quay.io/repository/jwillikers/gdb[quay.io/jwillikers/gdb]

Tags::
* `latest`

Supported architectures::
* `amd64` _(x86_64)_
* `arm` _(armhfp)_
* `arm64` _(aarch64)_

User:: The default user inside the container is named `user`.

Entrypoint:: `gdb`

Labels::
`io.containers.autoupdate=registry`::: Enables automatic updates when using Podman and the _fully-qualified_ image name.

== Quick Start

To access serial devices such as the {Black-Magic-Probe}, ensure your user is in the `dialout` group.

[source,sh]
----
sudo usermod -aG $USER dialout
----

NOTE: You'll have to log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

To connect to a serial console using GDB from within this container, use the following {Podman} command.
This command gives GDB access to the serial console device `/dev/ttyBmpGdb`.

[source,sh]
----
podman run \
    --rm \
    --group-add keep-groups \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    --device /dev/ttyBmpGdb \
    --volume $PWD:/home/user:Z \
    --name gdb \
    -it quay.io/jwillikers/gdb:latest \
    my-executable.elf
----

== Build

This project uses {Buildah} and {Podman} for building and testing the image.
A set of {pre-commit} checks are readily available to ensure your code is up-to-spec at the time it is committed.
Instructions for setting up a development environment, building the image, and testing the image follow.
These instructions are intended for users of {Fedora-Silverblue}, where the packages `buildah`, `git`, and `podman` are already available.
Moreover, I use the {fish} shell.

. Install the {fish} shell.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install fish
----

. Reboot to finish the installation.
+
[source,sh]
----
systemctl reboot
----

. Clone this repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone git@github.com:jwillikers/gdb-image.git
----

. Install {pre-commit}.
+
[source,sh]
----
pip install pre-commit
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
cd ~/Projects/gdb-image
----

. Install pre-commit's Git hooks.
+
[source,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. Run the shell script to build the image.
+
[source,sh]
----
buildah unshare ~/Projects/gdb-image/build.fish
----

. Test the image with the `test.fish` shell script.
+
[source,sh]
----
~/Projects/gdb-image/test.fish
